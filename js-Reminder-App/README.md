The goal of this project is to develop a to-do list application using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application will allow users to add, view, and complete tasks. The application will retrieve task data using an XHR call from a JSON file.

The user interface will have a simple and user-friendly design with a list of all to-do items displayed on the screen. Users will be able to click on a specific task to view its detailed view, which includes the task's title, description, due date, and time.

To add a new to-do item, users will be able to click on the "Add" button, which will open a new view where they can enter the task's title, description, due date, and time. The new task will not be persisted and will only be stored in the application's memory.

Users will also be able to mark a to-do item as complete by clicking on a checkbox associated with that task. Completed tasks will be visually distinguished from uncompleted tasks in the list.

The application will use SCSS for styling, and the code will be thoroughly documented to ensure ease of maintenance and future development. The project will have a .gitignore file to ignore files that are not needed for version control. There will also be a ReadMe.md file that contains the project's description, instructions to run the project, and any additional details about the project.

Overall, the project will provide a functional and visually appealing to-do list application that can help users stay organized and productive.
