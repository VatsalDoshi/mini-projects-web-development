This project is a simple calculator application built using JavaScript and Canvas API. The application provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. It allows the user to enter a mathematical expression using the provided buttons and evaluate it by clicking on the "=" button.

Additionally, the user can use the "Back" button to delete a character from the expression. If the user enters an invalid expression, an error message will be displayed in the value field to inform them of the mistake. The UI of the application is designed to look exactly like the provided mockup.

The application is developed using ES6 syntax and is extensively documented to make it easy to understand and maintain. The project comes with a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from the version control system and a ReadMe.md file with instructions on how to run the project.
