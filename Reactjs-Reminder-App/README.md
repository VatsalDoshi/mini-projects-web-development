In this assignment, we have created a Reminder App using ReactJS and REST APIs from Assignment 9. 

The app allows users to view all Reminder items, click on a specific item to view its details, add a new Reminder item by entering title, detail, and date-time, and close a Reminder item as complete. 

The technical requirements of the assignment include using fetch API to fetch data from the Node.js server, using SCSS for CSS, and creating the project using create-react-app.

Overall, this assignment is aimed at enhancing your skills and knowledge in ReactJS development.
